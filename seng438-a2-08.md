# 1 Introduction

In this lab we were given the task of writing unit tests for two classes from the JFreeChart framework (our SUT), Range (org.jfree.data.Range), and DataUtilities (org.jfree.data.DataUtilities). From these classes, our job was to look through the Javadocs corresponding to each class and test their methods based on the outlined requirements. To write these unit tests, we employed the use of the JUnit testing framework that utilized the use of test cases as well as JMock which utilized the use of mock objects for particular test cases in the DataUtilities class which required interfaces to be passed in. This lab allowed for us to refresh our memory on using the Eclipse IDE as well as the writing of automated unit tests using JUnit. It also tested our ability to browse through documentation and attain the required information regarding a particular method by having to look through the Javadocs for the respective classes. The concept of Mocking and the use of JMock is a new skill for our group members that we attained during this lab, as we were not previously familiar with it.

# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

Our team utilized Discord for communication. Initially we completed the “Familiarization” section together, where we set up Eclipse, the projects and its artifacts, tested the application, and then created a boilerplate JUnit test. We also browsed through the Javadoc documentation provided and familiarized ourselves with it. At this point we also divided up the work and split up the tasks and methods to test for the assignment. Once everyone completed their test cases we regrouped to review and check each other's tests to minimize our potential errors and so we all received a well-rounded experience and idea of the testing process for this assignment. 

# 5 Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

One of the main challenges we encountered during this lab is the implementation of mocking and using the JMock library to essentially simulate objects that we would otherwise have to pass in for particular methods. There was definitely a learning curve in terms of applying these new concepts and learning how to use the library to design our test cases for DataUtilities. The concept of mocking also has some potential drawbacks if not addressed properly, for instance the mock objects may not have all the required or correct values, parameters, attributes, etc. for testing a particular method which would be present in the object that is passed in during real development or use of the JFreeChart framework. This is a potential challenge we had to consider during the design of our test cases as sometimes a test could have potentially passed when in reality it should actually be failing. Designing and using the mock objects and classes was also a challenge, having to read through the Javadoc documentation to really get a grasp on what exactly each method was doing, what type of object needed to be passed in, etc. 

# 6 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

Sufyan: Overall, I felt that this lab assignment was much better for me when compared to lab assignment 1. This lab served as a great refresher of JUnit and Black Box testing for myself and introduced me very nicely to equivalence class testing, partitioning, and boundary value testing, as well as the structuring of a JUnit test. The one thing that I really appreciated in this lab was the familiarization section in the lab manual, which really allowed me to get a firm understanding of what is expected.
